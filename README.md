| [Counting Words](https://github.com/heispv/bioinformatics/blob/master/counting-words.ipynb) | To compute Count(Text, Pattern), our plan is to “slide a window” down Text, checking whether each k-mer substring of Text matches Pattern. We will therefore refer to the k-mer starting at position i of Text as Text(i, k) | 21 July 2023 |
| [What are the Best Common Patterns](https://github.com/heispv/bioinformatics/blob/master/frequent-words-problem.ipynb) | To calculate the `best common patterns` in a given sequence (ori), we can begin by creating a function that generates a `frequency table` of patterns based on their k-mer values. Then, we proceed to develop another function that identifies and selects the most frequently occurring patterns based on the k-mer values. By following these steps, we can effectively extract the most prevalent patterns in the ori sequence. | 21 July 2023 |
